#Welcome to What2Wear!


For the code review, the most useful things are in these folders and files:

1. folder What2WearAndroid, where you can find the code for our android app

2. folder app, where you can find the code for our website

3. file app.js, where you can find our old version of algorithm for deciding clothes, together with twilio

4. file findTest.js where you can find our final algorithm for deciding clothes


The rest contain our old design of pages, screenshots, some algorithms that are not yet implement etc.
